# Rolling-Code-for-RF-Modules
Secure Rolling Code Solution for 315/433 MHz RF Modules
# Overview
This project implements a secure rolling code transmitter (TX) for 315/433 MHz RF modules, providing a reliable and encryption-based solution to prevent replay attacks and ensure secure communication. The rolling code changes with every transmission, making it difficult for unauthorized devices to intercept and reuse transmitted codes.
# Features
Secure rolling code transmission for 315/433 MHz RF modules
Encryption using xxtea-iot-crypt library for added security
Unique code generated for every transmission
Compatible with RH_ASK (RadioHead Amplitude Shift Keying) library
Arduino-based implementation for easy integration
# Motivation
This project was born out of the need for a secure rolling code TX RX solution in a recent project, where replay attacks and unauthorized access were significant concerns. By sharing this implementation, we aim to provide a reliable and easy-to-use solution for makers and developers working with RF modules.
# Requirements
Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, ESP8266, ESP32)
315/433 MHz RF transmitter (TX) (RX) modules
RH_ASK library
xxtea-iot-crypt library
# Usage
Connect the RF TX module to your Arduino board.
Install required libraries (RH_ASK and xxtea-iot-crypt).
Modify the code to suit your specific needs (e.g., frequency, encryption key).
Upload the code to your Arduino board.
